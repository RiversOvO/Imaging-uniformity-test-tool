# Imaging-uniformity-test-tool
Project background:

As an independent developer, I developed an image analysis software through C++ and Python and called OpenCV library and Qt framework to test the image uniformity of binocular cameras. The software was designed to help the test department carry out more accurate image analysis, and finally the software was successfully used in the test department pipeline

My Job:
· Design the user interface using Qt Creator, load two images, calculate and display brightness and color uniformity in different areas of them, and implement user-defined threshold and contrast area functions

· Designed and implemented the function of saving test results and marking pictures

· Improved contrast mode of color uniformity, using CIEDE2000 standard

· Analyze the image by YOLOv5 model, and intelligently judge whether the brightness and color uniformity in the image are qualified
